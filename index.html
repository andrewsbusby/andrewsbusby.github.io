                    When he's not literalliy swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his compter designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in teh movement to teach the world <em>techincal sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like coding, command lines, and version contril, and "soft skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
